                    Introduction
                </div>
                <p>Dispatch Express started out as an idea to simplify. To simplify the 
			      previously complicated process of managing job tickets&nbsp;wirelessly. 
			      We've seen many vertical market applications out there that were difficult 
			      to manage and even more difficult to learn. Most of these applications had 
			      a huge footprint, needed tons of expensive hardware and software and 
			      required massive retraining of the employees.
				</p>
				
                <div class="article-title">
                    What It Does
                </div>				
                <p>Dispatch Express manages the process of getting 
			      job tickets from the operator's desktop computer onto the Mobile Data 
			      Computers (which reside in the vehicle of the employee).&nbsp; A typical 
			      job ticket includes To and From addresses, instructions on what to do at 
			      those destinations (be it pickup a person or an item or dropoff 
			      groceries), and the time/date information.&nbsp; The process is started by 
			      entering a Job Ticket into Dispatch Express.&nbsp; The ticket is then sent 
			      (either automatically or manually) to the employee in the field 
			      (driver).&nbsp; The driver then sends statuses back that signify the 
			      progress of the job.&nbsp; Thus the central office is kept abreast of the 
			      situation in the field and can make adjustments because of it.
				</p>
				  
			    <p>Typical customers for this software include 
			      trucking, taxi, courier, limo, pickup &amp; delivery and other 
			      companies.&nbsp; The size of companies that purchased the system was on 
			      average from 5 to 20 employees.&nbsp; These companies were attracted by 
			      the fact that very little technical expertise was required to run this 
			      application, as opposed to competing software many of which required RDBMS 
			      and various other servers.&nbsp; The customers typically didn't have an IT 
			      department.&nbsp;
				</p>
                <div class="article-title">
                    How It Works
                </div>
				<p>Dispatch Express is an application that is easy to 
			      use because the interface is simple, yet powerful. The advanced features 
			      reveal themselves as necessary. An average user will never have to deal 
			      with complexity. The jobs are logically divided into Reservations 
			      and&nbsp;Active&nbsp;Jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispatch Express&nbsp;also contains 
			      managers for Vehicles and Customers.&nbsp; Other modules of the 
			      application allow the user to send text messages, view completed jobs, 
			      modify program settings and create new orders.&nbsp; Because the 
			      functionality of the application is so logically and clearly separated, 
			      the users had no problems getting used to it.&nbsp; Most of them needed 
			      very minimal training - literally 5-10 minutes.
				</p>
                <div class="article-title">
                    Technologies Involved
                </div>				
			    <p> Dispatch Express was written in Visual Basic 5.&nbsp; 
				  Because it was designed to be simple to use and install, the 
			      requirements for it are very small.&nbsp; Standard PCs will do.&nbsp; At 
			      the same time the application is multiuser and capable of supporting up to 
			      15-20 concurrent users.&nbsp; To communicate wirelessly, Dispatch Express 
			      utilized 3rd Party Plugin architecture of Fleet Management 2000, which in 
				  turn was able to use several different wireless data providers.
