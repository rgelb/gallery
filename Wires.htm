                    The Problem
                </div>
                <p>Deutsche Bank was having trouble processing wires in a timely and inexpensive manner.  
				   The existing system provided for some automation, but required too much manual intervention 
				   by employees. Tasks such as approving wires for transfer were taking up much of the day
				   leaving other tasks unfinished and making wire processing a losing business for the bank.  The 
				   bank was in a amazing situation of having to turn down business because it could barely handle 
				   existing wires.  In addition, the employees were tired of basically running interference 
				   all day long.  Clearly, a change was needed and it was needed fast.
				</p>
				
                <div class="article-title">
                    The Solution
                </div>				
                <p>Having understood the existing system, I made a decision to use my JobStream middleware
				   platform to run what is a basically sequential process.  JobStream enabled me to pull 
				   together all the disparate pieces of technology needed to process wires.  The application 
				   provided a single entry point for wires via a web site.  Users (normally mortgage houses) 
				   would upload a data file, then receive a confirmation tracking number.  The JobStream Job 
				   would be scheduled for processing.  This job would process the file through 
				   our database, running various validations.  Then, the generated data would be handed off 
				   to yet another process that interacts with the Federal Reserve Bank.  
				</p>
				
				<p>Because of acquisitions, Deutsche Bank has several locations in US that process wires.  
				  Due to this situation, we used a series of loosely coupled applications to handle the 
				  entire load. </p>

                <div class="article-title">
                    The Benefit
                </div>
				<p>The deployment of the application resulted in significant changes to the way wires are processed 
				   within Deutsche Bank.  First of all, wire processing is the fastest-rising money earner 
				   in the Deutsche Bank US subsidiary.  It is now a very profitable venture.  Secondly, the amount of 
				   hand-holding by employees has been reduced dramatically.  Thirdly, since the application deployed, 
				   we've been doubling the amount of wires processed every month (geometric progression!).
