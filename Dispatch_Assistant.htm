                    Introduction
                </div>
                <p>Our customers who did not have a need for data applications still had drivers out there 
				   with a digital radios installed in their vehicle.  Given that these radios were fairly 
				   expensive, it made sense that the customers should get as much out of them as possible.
				   The goal was to reduce the amount of time the operators needed to spend talking to the 
				   drivers and vice versa.  The reason for that was fairly selfish.  Data customers paid more.
				   However, voice customers took up a lot of bandwidth. The trick was to reduce the amount of 
				   bandwidth used by voice customers (while not alienating them), so more space is available to 
				   bring on data customers.
				</p>
				
                <div class="article-title">
                    What It Does
                </div>				
                <p>Since the radios possessed some rudimentary messaging and statusing capabilities, we 
				   decided to write an application based on these features.  
				   Dispatch Assistant allows the dispatch operator to send and receive statuses and simple 
				   messages.  In addition, it allows group calls.  So, for instance, the operator can broadcast 
				   a status or a message to all drivers.  The drivers can send statuses back to let the 
				   front office know what is going on with them.  
				</p>
				  
			    <p>The profile of the target customer was someone who has a little bit experience 
				   using computers.  The interface was designed so that all the operations could 
				   be carried out using a mouse.  As such, we strove to create an application 
				   that put simplicity above all else. As a result, the application was well 
				   received and managed to significantly reduce the voice traffic on the system.
				</p>
                <div class="article-title">
                    How It Works
                </div>
				<p>Dispatch Assistant is an application that is easy to 
			      use because the interface is simple. The dispatch operator sends 
				  statuses the meaning of which has been previously defined to the 
				  drivers.  The drivers send statuses back.  In addition, the 
				  dispatchers can initiate a voice calls.  All the information is compiled 
				  into a series of reports that can be generated at will. 
				</p>

                    Technologies Involved
                </div>				
			    <p>Dispatch Assistant was written in Visual Basic 5.&nbsp; 
				  It used a local Microsoft Access MDB file to store all the data.  
				  The reports were generated using vsReports package.  The Wireless Serial Layer facilitated 
				  access to the radio network.  The database was accessed via DAO 3.51.
				  Many of the features were reused from the Dispatch Express application, which 
				  was developed prior.  Because of the component reuse methodology, Dispatch Assistant 
				  was delivered a full month before the deadline with associated monetary savings.
