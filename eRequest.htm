                    The Problem
                </div>
                <p>Loan Custody (that's what happens to your loan documents after you buy a house) 
				   is not a business that the public associates with banking.  However, 
				   for majors banks it is a profitable operation.  For some of them it is a very profitable
				   proposition.  The problem with Deutsche Bank was that it had several million documents 
				   sitting on the shelves.  Customers (usually mortgage or escrow brokers) would call or 
				   fax the request (for either a copy, withdrawal, execution, ...) for a particular set of loans, 
				   one of the employees would enter the data into a web application and submit a request to 
				   process the loan documents.
				</p>
				<p>One of the problems with this scenarios is that the employees spent half the day reading faxes
				   and entering the data into the existing web applications, instead of fulfilling customer's request.
				   In addition, efforts to open up the existing application to the internet failed because of the 
				   way the application was written. Number one, it was ASP session based.  This meant that if 
				   more than several people were logged into the web site, it would become unbearably slow.  And because
				   the entire application based on the Session technology, it would not be possible to update it 
				   to the current methods without a significant rewrite.  So a decision was made to rewrite it.
				</p>
				
                <div class="article-title">
                    The Solution
                </div>				
                <p>The rewrite was done using the 
				   <a href="http://www.vbrad.com/Articles/janmay01/art_aspless.htm">AspLess</a> methodology which guarantees ease of maintanance and 
				   debugging, which in turn yields fast development time, less bugs and better performance.  
				   Key employees were interviewed about their work flow, in an attempt to match the application with their 
				   workflow.  The idea was to have the customers enter requests for documents as much as possible 
				   via the internet to free up the employees to do useful work.  There was a benefit to the customers 
				   as well.  No longer would they have to generate faxes, make phone calls (and be on hold), then call 
				   again to see whether the request was fulfilled.  They would simply log on to the web site and track 
				   their request, like people can track UPS or FedEx packages.  In addition, a series of reports was 
				   created to better gauge system response time, to monitor and mine data.
				   
				   This was also the first application, where I've implemented data-entry-friendly features of 
				   Mozilla Firebird browser, such as type-ahead lookup.  So, those employees using this browser 
				   are able to speed through the data entry part much faster than others.

                <div class="article-title">
                    The Benefit
                </div>
				<p>
				   eRequest has managed to speed up loan processing by identifying bottlenecks in the previous system, 
				   by using data entry features and by paying close attention to detail.  As a result, Loan Custody 
				   is a very profitable business for Deutsche Bank.
